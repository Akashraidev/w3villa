# Introduction

The Login and Registration Form project is designed to develop a user authentication system. This system allows users to either log in with their existing credentials or register for a new account. The project employs HTML for form structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for validating and submitting the form.

Key Features:

- User Registration: Allows users to create new accounts by entering a username, email address, and password.
  
- Form Validation: Ensures that users fill in the required fields correctly before submission.
  
- Password Strength Meter: Displays the strength of the entered password to help users create strong passwords.
  
- Password Confirmation: Includes a field for users to re-enter their password to confirm it matches.
  
- Error Handling: Provides error messages to help users correct any invalid or missing information.
  
- User Login: Enables existing users to log in using their registered username and password.
  
- Persistence: Can be extended with backend functionality to store and verify user credentials.
